 * @title LeetCode 769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted
 * @author [Your Name]
 * @dev This contract implements a solution for the LeetCode problem 769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted
 *      https://leetcode.com/problems/max-chunks-to-make-sorted/
 *
 *      Difficulty: Medium
 *      Topics: Array
 *
 *      The problem is to find the maximum number of chunks we can make such that each chunk is sorted
 *      and the concatenation of all chunks is equal to the sorted array.
 *
 *      Example:
 *      Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
 *      Output: 1
 *      Explanation: We can split the array into a single chunk [4,3,2,1,0], and sort it to get [0,1,2,3,4].
 *
 *      Algorithm:
 *      - We can split the array into chunks such that each chunk is sorted.
 *      - We can then concatenate all chunks to get the sorted array.
 *      - We can split the array into chunks such that the maximum element in each chunk is less than or equal
 *        to the minimum element in the next chunk.
 *      - We can then count the number of chunks we can make using this approach.
 *
 *      Time Complexity: O(n)
 *      Space Complexity: O(1)
