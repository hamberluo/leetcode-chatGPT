/**
 * @title Stone Game
 * @author [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
 * 
 * @dev You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:
 * There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones.
 * The one who removes the last stone will be the winner.
 * You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
 * 
 * @dev Both you and your friend are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game.
 * Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
 * 
 * @dev Example:
 * Input: 4
 * Output: false 
 * Explanation: If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game;
 * No matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
 * 
 * @dev Constraints:
 * - 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
