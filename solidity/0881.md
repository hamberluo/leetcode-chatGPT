    function getProblemInfo() public pure returns (string memory) {
        string memory problemNumber = "881";
        string memory problemTitle = "Boats to Save People";
        string memory problemDifficulty = "Medium";
        string memory problemScope = "Greedy Algorithm";
        string memory problemDescription = "The i-th person has weight people[i], and each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit. Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person. (It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)";
        string memory problemSolution = "We sort the people by their weight in non-descending order. Then, we use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other starting from the end. We keep track of the number of boats needed and the total weight of the people on the boat. If the sum of the weight of the two people pointed by the two pointers is less than or equal to the limit, we move both pointers towards the center and add 1 to the number of boats needed. Otherwise, we only move the pointer pointing to the heavier person towards the center and add 1 to the number of boats needed. We repeat this process until the two pointers meet.";
        string memory algorithmComplexity = "Time Complexity: O(nlogn) for sorting the people by their weight in non-descending order. O(n) for the two pointers algorithm. Overall time complexity is O(nlogn). Space Complexity: O(1) since we only use constant amount of extra space to store the pointers and the number of boats needed.";
        return string(abi.encodePacked("Problem Number: ", problemNumber, "\nProblem Title: ", problemTitle, "\nDifficulty: ", problemDifficulty, "\nScope: ", problemScope, "\nDescription: ", problemDescription, "\nSolution: ", problemSolution, "\nAlgorithm Complexity: ", algorithmComplexity));

算法复杂度：时间复杂度为 O(nlogn)，空间复杂度为 O(1)。
