难度：中等

考察范围：SQL

题干：

Table: Employee

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+

The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.

Write an SQL query that finds all employees with at least 5 direct report.

解题思路：

这道题需要我们找到至少有5个直接下属的经理人，我们可以通过自连接来实现。

首先，我们需要找到每个经理人的直接下属数量，然后再筛选出直接下属数量大于等于5的经理人。

解决方案：

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name
FROM Employee e
JOIN (
    SELECT manager_id, COUNT(*) AS num
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY manager_id
) sub
ON e.employee_id = sub.manager_id
WHERE sub.num >= 5;
```

算法复杂度：时间复杂度为 O(nlogn)，空间复杂度为 O(n)。
